 Summary of What We Did

 To create a bootloader for STM32F303:
 1) Created main.c in the bootloader/ folder to control the boot process.
 2) Implemented a bootloader.c/ .h module containing ;
    * Bootloader_Init() for peripheral setup
    * Bootloader_CheckForUpdate() using GPIO
    * Bootloader_JumpToApp() to jump the application
3) Created gpio.c/ .h to read a pin that triggers bootloader mode.
4) Created uart.c/ .h to print debug messages and (later) receive firmware.
5) Prepared flash.c/ .h to :
    * Unlock flash memory
    * Erase old application
    * Write new firmware
